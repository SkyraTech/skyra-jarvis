# Jarvis Windows Desktop — Project Memory

## Maintained specification — current status

Updated 2026-10-15. This is one of the nine initial project documents and must be retained and updated in place. Remove only redundant per-work reports; do not replace or delete the initial specification set.

Implemented Windows control slice: dedicated React Flow subsystem canvas, project permissions, proposal review, approvals, coding checkpoints/evidence, stored conversations and recent events; Tauri Rust bridge, DPAPI credentials, hidden launcher and tray lifecycle. Release executable builds; native acceptance is recorded in the owning development tracker. Model chat, structured draft plans, setup-readiness and the flexible 3D/tabbed/multi-window workspace are implemented. Installer, signed updates, mobile pairing, configuration editing and automatic workflow scheduling remain pending. The legacy UI stays separate.

The following references hold the detailed current implementation; requirements and proposed designs below must not be read as already built:

- [Current architecture and database design](../../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Current functionality and implementation boundaries](../../../docs/FUNCTIONALITY.md)
- [Current milestone and verification summary](../../../docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)

## Current verification

Verification covers the production frontend build, browser acceptance, authenticated dashboard and policy conflicts, native bridge routing, Windows DPAPI and hidden launcher ownership. Native end-to-end evidence and any outstanding limitations are maintained in the owning development tracker.

## Completed work

Initial requirements, architecture, development/design standards, task plan, API direction, testing and security specifications are retained. Implementation remains at the status stated above.

## Pending work and next milestone

- Rust/MSVC prerequisites and portable Tauri release compilation are proven; installer packaging remains pending
- Native repair, tray and single-instance acceptance complement production-browser tests; see the owning development tracker for the exact release evidence
- Code signing and update distribution ownership are undecided

Follow the component task document and the owning project development tracker. Assign an owner and verify relevant acceptance checks before marking a task complete.

## Maintenance rules

Update this memory for current status, decisions, blockers and next work. Update the other initial documents when their requirements/design/contracts change; keep the detailed implemented database architecture reference aligned with code. Do not generate a new report per task. Git retains historical revisions. The owner stages/commits/pushes manually; the assistant reports a substantial verified milestone and waits for confirmation before proceeding.

## Windows control milestone memory

The first control slice now has source and a release executable: dedicated subsystem canvas, permission review, proposal/approval/run/evidence screens, stored history and recent events. Controller/worker tokens are DPAPI protected and retained by the native host. The hidden Python launcher is ownership-aware; closing hides to tray, while explicit Exit ends the application. Existing nine documents are retained and updated. Exact verification/artifact details and remaining native checks live in the owning development tracker; no staging, commits or pushes were performed by the assistant.

## Conversation and draft planning

Current conversation/planning status: schema 7, deterministic tests and live Gemini chat/Groq draft-plan checks implemented. A Groq schema-prompt issue was caught by the live probe and corrected; failed requests remain terminal. Exact native release proof and full counts live in the owning development tracker. No staging, commits or pushes. Next: trusted configuration editing and explicit plan-to-build handoff.

## Flexible 3D workspace

The flexible workspace phase adds a 3D core, tab shell and independent native panels. Tab metadata is automatically restored; visited tab drafts survive switching/minimization within the session but are not persisted across application restart or tab closure. Saved native window arrangements are restored explicitly from Arrange. The main window closes to tray; child windows close independently. Detailed verification and final release evidence belong to the owning development tracker. No legacy assistant code or user data was removed.

# Skyra Coding Worker — Security and Operations

## Maintained specification — current status

Updated 2026-10-14. This is one of the nine initial project documents and must be retained and updated in place. Remove only redundant per-work reports; do not replace or delete the initial specification set.

Implemented: selected-file snapshots, guarded file operations, explicitly owner-enabled native Windows test execution and durable controller-supplied repair workflows. Online-model patch generation, branch/revision delivery and the new desktop are pending. Native execution carries Windows account privileges; Docker isolation is optional and not live-verified.

The following references hold the detailed current implementation; requirements and proposed designs below must not be read as already built:

- [Current architecture and database design](../../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Current functionality and implementation boundaries](../../../docs/FUNCTIONALITY.md)
- [Current milestone and verification summary](../../../docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)

Prepared: 2026-10-14. Requirement/design baseline. Use the maintained current-status section above to distinguish implemented work from planned work.

## Trust boundaries

User/agent input, webpages, repository text, messages, documents and external MCP output are untrusted data. They cannot change system policy or authorize a tool. Enforce actor, tenant, project, account and resource scope server-side. Child jobs can narrow permissions but cannot expand them.

## Permission modes

Support read-only, ask-before-action, selected-action grants, scoped full access and custom policies. Full access is bounded by its configured resources and actor; it does not mean global administrator. Approval binds normalized action/payload hash, resource, account, policy version, approver and expiry. Recheck before execution and invalidate on changes or revocation. Preserve immutable audit records for decisions and outcomes.

## Secrets and remote access

Use OS-protected credentials on Windows and a managed secret store when hosted; encrypt sensitive durable tokens, restrict file permissions and rotate/revoke connections. Never include secrets in prompts, logs, URLs, process arguments or frontend bundles. OAuth uses verified state/PKCE where applicable, strict redirects and minimum scopes. Webhooks verify signatures and replay windows.

Local loopback is not automatically trusted: authenticated IPC/API and origin checks are required. Mobile control uses revocable pairing and encrypted transport; do not expose an unauthenticated desktop port to the Internet. Choose remote connectivity after threat review. Report local-machine offline state honestly; always-on intake/alerts require a hosted component.

## Data lifecycle

Separate operational state, conversations, curated memory, audit events and artifacts. Define retention by data class and organization policy before launch; support export and permitted deletion including search indexes and derived copies. Audit retention and legal/business requirements may differ from conversation deletion. Backups use restricted access and encryption; test restoration into an isolated environment. Never commit live credentials or customer fixtures.

## Operations and recovery

Expose readiness and liveness separately, with sanitized dependency status. Correlate logs/metrics/traces using run and request IDs. Alert on sustained failures, queue age, lease expiry, provider throttling and credential expiry; deduplicate alerts and define escalation ownership. Structured logs avoid message bodies by default.

Deploy/release candidates include exact versions, migrations, rollback constraints and evidence. Prefer reversible application changes; database rollback requires an explicit data-preservation plan. On incident: contain within preauthorized policy, collect evidence, reproduce in isolation, prepare fix, run quality gates, request the configured release decision, then observe results. Do not label a fix production-ready solely because an agent generated it.

## Project-specific decisions

- Git worktrees alone do not provide process or filesystem isolation
- Windows-native and container execution support different toolchains
- Isolation technology is an implementation gate, not a command-blacklist assumption

Package-only projects apply supply-chain/release controls and consumer tests; they do not need invented runtime endpoints or operational databases.


## Reviewed new-file coding - 2026-10-15

Creation targets are trusted host configuration. Models cannot expand the selection, create protected tests, pick commands or overwrite existing files. Creation uses exclusive binary open, flush and fsync inside the existing guarded action transaction. File effects cannot roll back with SQLite: a crash or I/O failure after creation remains uncertain and requires reconciliation; do not automatically replay or overwrite. Native execution retains Windows account access and is not OS isolation.
